							<p>Take a look at my work history, certifications and roles at my previous employers.  I have learned so much at each one and have gained a vast skillset that allows me to have knowledge of how I can go about solving complicated issues or help with researching new features.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I follow local and national Health Systems (many of which that I had worked with on integrations), Healthcare Technology Vendors, Information Security, and all things Tech related.  I am always interested in learning about new technologies and advancements especially if there is a lab that I can work through within my homelab environment.</p>
							<br>
							<p>When I am not working I am usually tinkering around with my homelabs and AWS instances while studying for other certifications, working on projects of my own or just out of general curiosty to learn something new.</p>

							<h3>BlastExtend</h3>
							<p>This project was born out of being able to reach out to a large group of users that were on old versions of an app and being able to export user lists from our APM to a .csv file.  Previously the Customer Care Team was messaging each user individually.</p>
							<ul class="actions special">

						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Python.png"/></span>
							<h3>Dupes</h3>
							<p>During implementation processes we were running into the issue of users having accounts associated to other healthcare systems.  This posed an issue as users could possibly miss messages so this allowed me to find the duplicates ahead of time so the Project Teams could make the decisions ahead of Go-Lives.</p>
							<ul class="actions special">

						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/VS.png"/></span>
							<h3>ADParser</h3>
							<p>Another application built out of the AD synch process this allows to convert the AD file from JSON format to a readable CSV.  This allowed us to easily find issues with user or shared accounts that caused issues with the creation of new users when they may have had a special character that would cause our program to escape from running.</p>

								<h2>My Interests/Bio</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Originally majoring in Mechanical Engineering the recession soon hit the USA and the struggles for many were finding co-ops at that time.  When co-ops were not highering we were placed back into classes and during that time I had built my first computer which reinvigorated my love of computers since I was a kid and made the decision to move into Information Technology.  While in school I held full time jobs where I would be learning more than what was being taught in school.  I am self taught in a lot of the skills that I have learned over the years wether they be for Vendor certifications or just general curiosity I've always had the drive to learn all that I can.</p>
							<p>Many of my hobbies revolve around the use of technology.  I build and race cars in autocross, rallycross and drag racing.  Growing up I was involved in most every sport that a person could play but these days you will find me at the golf course, inline hockey rink or the bowling alley.  I have dedicated servers in my home that I use for different labs, Virtual Machines, network hosts and docker containers.</p>
							<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my profile.  I hope to hear from you soon!  I can be reached at either my email or LinkedIn which are at the top and bottom of this site.</p>
